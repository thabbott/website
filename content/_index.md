<p style="margin-top: 0; text-align: justify">I am a postdoc working with <a href="http://nadirjeevanjee.com/">Nadir Jeevanjee</a> at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. My research uses a combination of pen-and-paper theory and idealized numerical models to study the dynamics of clouds and convection, with an emphasis on understanding how interactions with other components of the Earth system influence weather and climate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I received my PhD from MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, advised by <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~twcronin/www/">Tim Cronin</a>. I did my undergraduate work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I majored in Computer Science and worked as a research assistant with <a href="https://www.math.wisc.edu/~stechmann/">Sam Stechmann</a>.</p>
