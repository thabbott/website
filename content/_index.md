I am a graduate student working with [Tim Cronin](http://web.mit.edu/~twcronin/www/) in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. My PhD research uses theory and idealized numerical models to study how interactions between clouds and the surrounding environment influence the weather and climate of Earth's tropics.

I did my undergraduate work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I majored in Computer Science and worked as a research assistant with [Sam Stechmann](https://www.math.wisc.edu/~stechmann/).
