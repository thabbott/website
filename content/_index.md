I am a ~~graduate student~~ postdoctoral associate (as of May 2021) working with [Tim Cronin](http://web.mit.edu/~twcronin/www/) in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. My research uses a combination of pencil-and-paper theory and idealized numerical models to study the dynamics of clouds and convection, with an emphasis on understanding how interactions with other components of the Earth system influence weather and climate.

I did my undergraduate work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I majored in Computer Science and worked as a research assistant with [Sam Stechmann](https://www.math.wisc.edu/~stechmann/).
